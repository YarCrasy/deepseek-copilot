# Change Log

## [0.1.2] - 2026-07-23

- Added the opt-in `auto-approve` permission mode, which delegates approval to DeepSeek for all non-disabled tools while retaining schemas and workspace path validation.
- Reorganized settings into a clearer General section and improved the English, Spanish, and Chinese interface translations.
- Added an explicit confirmation before continuing when a conversation reaches the tool-call round limit.
- Fixed pending tool confirmations remaining visible after cancellation.
- Fixed active conversation identity being lost when history was updated.
- Aligned the maximum output-token setting with DeepSeek's 384K-token limit.
- Added an in-repository technical wiki covering architecture, tools, storage, the DeepSeek API, testing, and maintenance.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-17

- Replaced text markers with a native chronological timeline for reasoning, content, and tool groups.

- Hardened DeepSeek SSE parsing, response validation, URL handling, timeouts, and bounded retries.
- Added multi-root conversation association, bounded context, staged Git context, binary detection, delimited references, `AGENTS.md` limits, and optimistic file hashes.
- Moved settings and per-conversation history to `~/.yrs-dpsk-copilot/` with atomic writes, validation, retention, quotas, corruption isolation, pagination, bulk deletion, and Undo.
- Completed the accessible chat, confirmation, settings, and history flows; added English, Spanish, and Chinese webview localization.
- Fixed history deletion and new-chat state synchronization, including clearing Chat view when the active conversation is removed.
